  <h2>About the Project ðŸš”	</h2>

 <p>
Europe is experiencing the rise of far-right movements that constantly fuel fear of the foreign population through false data that create non-existent social alarms.
 </p>
 <p>
In Spain, for example, these groups spread baseless figures that accuse people of foreign origin (mainly African) and directly link them to the increase in crime in the country.
</p>
<p>
That is why this data exploration aims to disprove these alarming claims that assert that 40% of crimes committed in Spain are perpetrated by foreigners.
</p>
<p>
  In the face of the impunity of lies spread solely to gain political advantage, data analysis emerges as an indispensable tool to curb this type of injustice.
</p>
  
  <h3>Objective:</h3>
  <p>
   In this project, I compare real data gathered by official institutions to prove my hypotesis: alt-righ fake news are lying to people and creating an awful idea about the inmigration in Spain. My point is to dismiss this false info that overloads our media and some policical speechs.
  </p>
  
  <h3>Methodology:</h3>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Gathering:</strong> Download a specific dataset from <a href="https://www.ine.es/dyngs/INEbase/es/categoria.htm?c=Estadistica_P&cid=1254735573206">INE (Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica) to analyze the real data about crime in Spain by condemned's origin.</a> </li>
    <li><strong>Data Preprocessing and EDA:</strong> Adjusting and fixing the data gathered for a deep exploration. Studying through EDA the stadistics crime by crime for, after that, make a general analysis of the total crimes and the relation with the origins.</li>
    <li><strong>Conclusions in Slides:</strong> Applying NLP to the synopses of the titles through an ML pipeline that will classify the entries according to moods.</li>
    <li><strong>Netflix Recommender:</strong> Creating the code for the recommender, which will offer titles based on the inputs provided by the user.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Work in Progress :warning:</h2>

  <p>
    
For now, I am still working on the project. It is almost finished (EDA complete, main recommender functions developed...), however, I still need to fine-tune the recommender's filtering options and create a Streamlit framework to present and demonstrate its functionality.
